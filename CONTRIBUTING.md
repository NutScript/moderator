# Contributing guidelines

General guidelines and requirements when contributing.

## CONTRIBUTORS WANTED: LOOK INSIDE

Hey,

First, thanks for considering helping out with the project. Any contribution
of any size is masively appreciated!

I really hope you read this document to the end because some of it is actually really important
(e.g., the legal section)

## Versioning

When bumping the version number, please use SemVer-style versioning (Major, Minor, Patch).

See https://semver.org for more details.

## Commit titles

Please prefix your commits with semantic commit prefixes.

See https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/semantic_commit_messages for example prefixes.

## Branching

We use gitflow-style branches. What this means is that all changes should eventually end up on ```develop/```
and master should be reserved as a stable branch.

When making larger features, ideally, you should branch from ```develop/``` onto ```feature/dope-new-feature```.

To make your life easier, installing [gitflow-avh](https://github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow-avh) would probably
make the most sense. However, it is not necessary.

## Legal

Unfortunately, the word is a cruel place. And, so, we must require a little bit of legalese from you in
order to protect ourselves and all other contributors.

Before contributing, you'll need to sign the CLA. If you object to anything there, please email me at:
[omar@assadi.co.il](mailto:omar@assadi.co.il)

You can sign the individual CLA over here: https://cla-assistant.io/NutScript/moderator
